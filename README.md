# ToPy #
## Topology Optimisation using Python ##

Exported from Google Code, nothing more. Please see the wiki branch for now (_not much there_); I'll upload everything in due course when I have a bit more time (I have a 'real' job).

## Plans (not cast in stone, not necessarily in this order) ##
1. Upload all the code, and update my contact details.
2. Create a wiki page for the installation, currently a PDF.
2. Show how to define a problem via Gmsh, or at least with the help of Gmsh. I'm not sure this is even going to be possible, and I need to get up to speed with Gmsh...
3. Create a simple Tkinter (no, I'm *not* going to use the amazing Qt lib, it's yet another set of dependencies and things I need to think about) interface to define simple problems instead of typing it out in a text editor.
