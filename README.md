# ToPy

Topology optimisation (or optimization) using Python -- ToPy

ToPy can solve compliance (stiffness), heat and mechanism problems, in 2D and 3D. The interface is limited, for example, there's
no fancy GUI; you have to define a problem in a text file (a TPD file, short for ToPy Problem Definition) using keywords
that descibe the parameters. Not too cumbersome once you get the hang of it.

ToPy was originally hosted on Google Code, please refer to the [ToPy wiki](https://github.com/williamhunter/topy/wiki)
